## Temporary 4K version
Apple has released another set of videos that have 4K support.  This isn't currently supported in the main branch, but a user has forked this project and added support.  To use the 4K video's instead, download Aerial.exe and Aerial.scr from [this folder](https://github.com/jonathonwpowell/Aerial/tree/temp4krelease/ScreenSaver/bin/Release).  Then run the exe from anywhere, click the settings button in the top right, and go to the video source tab and click the 4K button and save.  Close out of that program, then install the scr as you normally would and it should now use the 4K videos.

## Compatibility
Aerial is written in C# for [.Net Framework v4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130).

## FAQ

> After insalling on Windows XP, 7, 8.1, I get an error message "This application could not be started"

Please [install Microsoft's .Net Framework 4.6](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2715633).

> The app freezes or returns to desktop?

Try to install `Windows Media Player` via `Turn Windows features on or off` in the control panel.

> Blank black screen on screen saver preview?

The application needs an internet connection to work.

> BitBlocker / McAfee / execution blocking the download?

Historically `.scr` files have a bad history with anti-virus software â€” erroneously positive reports of this screensaver being a Malware or Generic Trojan or Unverified Executable is a [known issue](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/9), you can help by [reporting the source](https://www.opswat.com/blog/what-do-i-do-if-engine-detects-my-safe-file-threat) of this open source repository to the faulty anti-virus software companies. The builds are verified to be clean.

> Where are the .mov files located on Apple TV servers?

The movie files are [located at apple.com](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/55), they are cached to your local user directory, usually this: `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Aerial` 

> There's a red line on the screen saver!

This is an issue with video cards and  Windows Media Player, this can be solved by [disabling 'Demo Mode'](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/71#issuecomment-250318463).

> How do I setup a proxy?

To setup proxy information, create a [.config file as shown](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/87) alongside the screensaver.

> How do I change my screen saver on the most recent update of Windows 10?

Press the windows key, type in "lock screen settings", then it will be under "Screen Saver Settings" on that page.
